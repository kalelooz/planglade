### UI-001 — Approved-resource UI remediation

- Status: **PASS**
- Requested: 2026-08-26
- Scope: fix the verified frontend audit findings in the public repository first, then import the reviewed shared patch into the private cloud repository.
- Acceptance: mobile touch targets meet the project 44px standard; route surfaces are code-split; reduced-motion behavior is intentional; the approved frontend resource and design contract is documented; focused tests, lint, build, detector, and representative browser checks pass independently in both repositories.
- Publication: no push, release, deployment, or remote repository mutation is authorized by this task.

### Evidence

- 2026-08-26: all 110 frontend tests, lint, typecheck, reference build, and 3 Playwright reference checks passed.
- 2026-08-26: mobile Tasks checks proved 40 frequent controls at a minimum 44×44px with no horizontal overflow at 320px or 390px.
- 2026-08-26: route and vendor splitting reduced the entry chunk to 345.28kB / 99.51kB gzip and removed Vite's large-chunk warning.
- 2026-08-26: desktop and mobile browser inspection passed with no runtime warnings or errors; evidence is under `artifacts/verification/UI-001/` (intentionally ignored).
- 2026-08-26: the Impeccable detector's four warnings were reviewed as existing false positives: Markdown blockquote styling, a functional timeline resize handle, and mutually exclusive project-status color branches.
